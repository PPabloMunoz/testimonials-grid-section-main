                            <p>I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were current,
                                if not more so, in the company I joined.

                                transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up
                                for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter.

                                the course, I’ve successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR
                                startup.</p>
